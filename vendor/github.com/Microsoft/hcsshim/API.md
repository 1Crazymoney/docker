This is the preferred method rather than the legacy `CreateContainer` API. Supported on RS1 and later.- RS1..RS4: Makes legacy `v1` schema calls into HCS- RS5: Makes `v2` schema calls into HCS`CreateContainerEx(createOptions *CreateOptions) (Container, error)`**CreateOptions**- `Spec`. OCI specification for the container or utility VM being created - `Options`. Map of extensible options controlling how the API operates- `HostingSystem`. Optional Container object representing a utility VM in which the container should be created.Possible options:`HCSOPTION_SCHEMA_VERSION`- Optional- JSON string requesting a specific schema version eg `{"Major":2, "Minor":0}``HCSOPTION_OWNER`-----------**EXAMPLES**This section explains the parameters required on create calls for the various types of containers and schema versions.**ALL**Spec.Windows.LayerFolders is required on all calls.  For historical reasons, the (non-intuitive) ordering is: Top most read-only layer folder; other read-only layers; Base layer; Sandbox. For example, consider an image built from microsoft/windowsservercore:1709 with a single additional read-only layer where foo.txt has been added. The order would be (index 0..3)- Additional read-only layer with foo.txt- Servicing layer for the 1709 image (eg 10.0.16299.371 as at April 2018)- Base or "RTM" layer for the 1709 image - Read-Write sandbox layer**v1 Argon** (RS1 or later)- `HCSOPTION_SCHEMA_VERSION` SchemaV10().String(). Required on RS5 as will default to V2. Optional on RS1..RS4- `Spec.Windows.Root`. Optional. If supplied, is a volume GUID of a path where the storage filter driver is loaded. If omitted, the storage will be mounted using `LayerFolders`, and it is the responsibility of the caller to unmount.Examples: `TestV1Argon`, `TestV1ArgonAutoMount`, `TestV1ArgonMultipleBaseLayersAutoMount`**v2 Argon** (RS5 or later)- `Spec.Windows.Root`. Optional. If supplied, is a volume GUID of a path where the storage filter driver is loaded. If omitted, the storage will be mounted using `LayerFolders`, and it is the responsibility of the caller to unmount.Examples: `TestV2Argon`, `TestV2ArgonAutoMountMultipleBaseLayers`, `TestV2ArgonMultipleBaseLayers`**v1 Xenon WCOW** (RS1 or later)Notes:- HCS will handle the lifetime of the utility VM and mount/unmount the containers storage. No API controls are available- Memory sizing of the utility VM is through an algorithm internal to HCS. No API controls are available.- `HCSOPTION_SCHEMA_VERSION` SchemaV10().String(). Required on RS5 as will default to V2. Optional on RS1..RS4- `Spec.Windows.HyperV`. Must be non-nil- `Spec.Windows.HyperV.UtilityVMPath`. Optional. Folder containing the UtilityVM image. Note this is the `UtilityVM` folder, not `UtilityVM\Files` as required by the v2 schema. The helper function `LocateWCOWUVMFolderFromLayerFolders` can be useful to obtain the folders base.Examples: `TestV1XenonWCOW`, `TestV1XenonWCOWNoUVMPath`, `TestV1XenonMultipleBaseLayersNoUVMPath`**v2 Xenon WCOW** (RS5 or later)In the v2 schema, it is the responsibility of the caller to create and manage the lifetime of the utility VM. Some steps are optional from the client perspective and can be automatically performed. *Utility VM** The sandbox folder (passed at the top-most layer folder) will be created if it does not exist* sandbox.vhdx will be automatically created based on the locating the top-most (serviced) read-only layer in the set of layer folders based on SystemTemplate.vhdx, and permissions will be set based on the utility VM ID.* Even if sandbox.vhdx exists in the sandbox folder, it will be overwritten. - `HCSOPTION_SCHEMA_VERSION` SchemaV20().String(). Required.- `HCSOPTION_IS_UTILITY_VM`. Must be a non-empty string. e.g. "yes"- `Spec.Windows.Resources.CPU.Count`. Optional. Defaults to 2 unless on a single LP machine.- `Spec.Windows.Resources.Memory.Limit`. Optional. Defaults to 1GB.Note - for resources, the helper function `UVMResourcesFromContainerSpec` is useful to mirror functionality built into HCS in the v1 APIs. Generally only useful when sizing a utility VM knowing that a single container is going to be started in it, it rounds the memory to be slightly larger.*Container*- `HCSOPTION_SCHEMA_VERSION` SchemaV20().String(). Required.- `HCSOPTION_COMBINED_LAYERS` ajskdlfjakslNote: Multiple containers can be created inside the utility VM.Note: The containers storage is automatically mounted in the utility VM unless HCSOPTION_COMBINED_LAYERS is passed.Examples:  `TestV2XenonWCOW`, `TestV2XenonWCOWTwoContainers`, `TestV2XenonWCOWCreateLots`
